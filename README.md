# Pokemon Express App

![](https://i.imgur.com/rRKtN1B.jpg)

**Objective:** Make a Pokemon app that displays data inside server-side rendered views.

##### The User Stories

- When a user goes to the `/pokemon` route they will see an `index` of pokemon: the names of each pokemon rendered to the page.
- When a user clicks on the name of the pokemon, they will be taken to that pokemon's `show` page, and will see the pokemon's name and image.
- When a user goes to `/pokemon/new` a user sees a form that allows them to create a brand new pokemon, and then redirects the user back to `/pokemon`

##### Instructions

Use your notes from today and your fruits and vegetables app to make the New and Create Routes Correctly.

##### Set up the file structure

- `mkdir [repoName]`
- `cd [repoName]`
- `mkdir views`
- `touch views/Index.jsx`
- `touch views/Show.jsx`
- `mkdir models`
- `touch models/pokemon.js`
- `touch server.js`
- `touch .gitignore`
- `npm init -y`

ðŸ”´ Commit:
"All my files are created"

##### Install NPM packages

- `npm i express`
- `npm i jsx-view-engine react react-dom`
- check your `package.json`
- Approximate package.json

"All my npm packages are added"

##### Set up your server
- require express
- set `express()` to a variable
- set a variable of `port` to `3000`
- set your app to listen to the port and include a `console.log()`, so that you can tell when your server is running
- include a get route `/` that will `res.send('Welcome to the Pokemon App!');` so that when you got to `localhost:3000`, you will see `Welcome to the Pokemon App!`
- run `nodemon`
- go to `localhost:3000`
- check that you have your `Welcome to the Pokemon App!` message displaying

ðŸ”´ Commit:  
"My server is set up and running"

##### Set up your _'database'_

- You have created a file called `pokemon.js`
- Inside of this file, put the following array of pokemon objects. This is your 'database' for tonight's homework, copy and paste it **as is**! You'll notice the image url's are missing something, this is _intentional_, do not edit anything directly inside the 'database'!

```js
const pokemon = [
  { name: "bulbasaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/bulbasaur" },
  { name: "ivysaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/ivysaur" },
  { name: "venusaur", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/venusaur" },
  { name: "charmander", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charmander" },
  { name: "charizard", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/charizard" },
  { name: "squirtle", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/squirtle" },
  { name: "wartortle", img: "http://img.pokemondb.net/artwork/wartortle" },
];
```

- Set up your 'database' so that it can be exported to your `server.js` and then be required by your `server.js`
- Set this 'database' to a variable called `pokemon` in your `server.js` file
- Create a get route `/pokemon` that will `res.send(pokemon)`, which will display your pokemon data as json in the browser

ðŸ”´ Commit:  
"Connected my database, can see json in the browser"

##### Set up your index view

- Instead of displaying json at your `/pokemon` route, you should serve the `Index.jsx` file you created that will display your pokemon
- You will have to set up your jsx file

  - Start with your html boilerplate code
  - Add an `<h1>` that describes this page, i.e. 'See All The Pokemon!'
  - Try adding some inline styles:
  - We can add inline CSS, which are specified as attributes and are passed to the elements. These are specified as an object with a key as camelCased style name & value being the actual style value (and not as a string).

```js
const myStyle = {
  color: '#ffffff',
  backgroundColor: '#000000',
  };

  class MyFirstComponent extends React.Component() {
  return (
    <div style={myStyle}>My First React Component!</div>;
  }
}
```

- Change your `/pokemon` route to `res.render` your `Index.jsx` file
- In your browser, go to `localhost:3000/pokemon` and be sure to see your `Index.jsx` view with an `h1` tag

"index.jsx view rendered at pokemon route"

##### Show pokemon data in Index view

- Continue working on your `Index.jsx` view so that you can see:

  - The name of each pokemon, as a list item, inside an unordered list
  - This list should be dynamically rendered by jsx based on your data from your 'database'
  - You'll notice the pokemon names aren't properly capitalized! Let's fix that! Manipulate the data **programatically** to capitalize the first letter of their names

"I can view a list of all my pokemon in the browser"

##### Set up show route

- Inside your `server.js`, add a new get route `/pokemon/:id`
- That will `res.send(req.params.id);`
- So, when you go to `localhost:3000/pokemon/whatever`
- `whatever` will show up in the browser

ðŸ”´ Commit:  
"Show view shows req.params.id "

##### Link your `Index.jsx` to your `Show.jsx`

- Inside your `Index.jsx`,

  - For each pokemon, add an `<a>` tag that will have an `href` that goes to the route `/pokemon/x`, where x is the array position of the `pokemon` in the data array. This should be set dynamically with jsx
  - When you click the link you should go to your show route and the index number corresponding to the pokemon's array position should be displayed

ðŸ”´ Commit:  
"Added dynamic anchor tags to index.jsx "

##### Render your individual pokemon in the show view

- Copy/paste your code from your `Index.jsx` into your Sshow.jsx\`
- Change all your html code inside your `Show.jsx` file so that

  - Your h1 tag says "Gotta Catch 'Em All"
  - Add an h2 tag that will display the name of the pokemon
  - Add an image tag that will display an image of the pokemon
  - Add an anchor tag with the text of `back`, that will take you back to your `Index.jsx` view

- Update the route in the server.js to render the show view with the pokemon data
- Oh no! The image is broken because in our database the image links don't have the `.jpg` ending, let's fix that **programatically**! _Without_ going back to the database and editing it there, add on `.jpg` to the end of the pokemon's image data
